  // println product(multiplication) of odd squares of numbers from 1 to user input
  //so user enters 5
  // answer would be 1*9*25 = 225

  // so for reduce part you should define mult function or you could write it inline but that is a bit harder

  // goal would be to use view map filter reduce in a single line
  //you can do it first in separate operations of course
